# macros

A syntax/specification for defining macros for any sort of text file.
The goal of this is to be minimal but intuitive and with enough features to make
it worth using. It doesn't come with any features that you won't be using really
regularly. 

The idea is to avoid having to type long words over and over again without
overly relying on pronouns if it would make the writing less clear.

## features 

- [automatic plurals (can also be manually changed on a word by word basis)](syntax.md#plurals)
- [intuitive capitalization](syntax.md#capitalization)
- [sourcing macros from external files](syntax.md#external-definitions)

## syntax

The syntax can be found [here](syntax.md)

## python implementation

A python implementation can be found [here](pymacro/)
